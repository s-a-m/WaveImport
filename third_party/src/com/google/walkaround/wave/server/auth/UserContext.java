/**
 * Holds information about the user we are acting as.  Many helper classes
 * receive a {@code UserContext} for making OAuth requests or for attributing
 * actions (for example, incoming deltas) to the current user.
 *
 * For each request, this starts out unintialized, since we have no uniform way
 * of identifying the user.  Authentication filters like
 * {@link InteractiveAuthFilter} and {@link RpcAuthFilter} implement different
 * means of identifying the user and populate the {@code UserContext}
 * accordingly, including reading OAuth credentials from persistent storage.
 *
 * Servlets like {@link OAuthCallbackHandler} that need to manipulate
 * credentials in special ways populate the {@link UserContext} directly.
 *
 * Attempting to call a getter method while the corresponding information is not
 * present will result in an exception.  This makes it easy to tell when
 * a servlet is not using the right authentication filter.
 *
 * This class is not thread-safe; if we ever use more than one thread for a
 * single request, we'll have to think about thread safety.
 *
 * This class is structurally similar to {@link AccountStore.Record} but plays a
 * very different role -- {@code UserContext} is mutable to allow authentication
 * filters (and other classes that handle login) to pass information about the
 * current user to other classes that need it, while {@code AccountStore.Record}
 * is an immutable in-memory representation of a record in {@link AccountStore}.
